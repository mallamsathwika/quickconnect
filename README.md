# Video Chat Application


This application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to initiate video calls. Users can connect with family, friends, colleagues, or strangers, depending on their privacy settings and preferences. The application typically offers features such as one-on-one video calls, group video calls, and instant messaging, during the chat session using Google authentication

This application is built using the PeerJS library, socket.io and Node.JS library for managing the server. The design for this project is inspired by Google Meet and would look to improve both design and utility in the near future.
